# EO 14067 — Red-Team Debunk (Pass C)

Scope: Test common claims about EO 14067 against the Federal Register text, Federal Reserve materials, and FSOC reporting.

Findings:
- “EO 14067 created or launched a U.S. CBDC.” False. Sec. 4 instructs research; issuance would require authorizing law.
- “EO 14067 bans or restricts private crypto.” False. The EO assigns assessments and coordination; no ban language.
- “EO 14067 lets the government freeze or ‘turn off’ money.” False. No such authority appears; general provisions preserve existing authorities; Fed states cash remains and FedNow is not a CBDC.
- “EO 14067 appropriates funds or creates new agencies.” False. EOs cannot appropriate; coordination uses existing authorities.
- “EO 14067 amended or revoked prior EOs.” False. No amend/revoke clauses within 14067 itself.
- “EO 14067 mandates surveillance or a social credit system.” False. The text directs risk assessments and international standards work.

Residual Red Items: None; any reintroduced low-verifiability language should be quarantined pending direct citations.
