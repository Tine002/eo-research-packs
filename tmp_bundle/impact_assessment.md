# Scope
Executive Order 14067 (Mar. 9, 2022) states a whole-of-government approach to digital assets across consumer/investor protection, financial stability, illicit finance, international coordination, and CBDC research. It does not create new spending or regulations by itself; actions occur through existing statutory authorities, interagency reports, and subsequent rulemaking.

# Mechanisms and Pathways
**Administrative (Executive Branch):**
- APNSA/APEP coordinate interagency process; departments and independent regulators participate via existing mandates (FR Sec. 3). citeturn0search0
- Taskings include assessments (e.g., FSOC risk report), policy options, and international engagement (Secs. 4, 6–8). citeturn0search0

**Regulatory:**
- Financial regulators evaluate gaps and may propose rules under existing statutes; FSOC identifies systemic risk issues and coordination needs (2022 FSOC digital-asset report). citeturn0search2
- Agencies with market, consumer, and banking oversight (SEC, CFTC, CFPB, OCC, FDIC) act within their statutes; EO states priorities but does not expand jurisdiction. (FR Sec. 3; FSOC report). citeturn0search0turn0search2

**Budget/Appropriations Context:**
- EOs cannot appropriate funds; agencies implement using enacted budget authority subject to appropriations law (Antideficiency Act; CRS/GAO overviews). citeturn2search12turn2search13turn2search10
- New initiatives beyond baseline require inclusion in the President’s Budget and congressional action. citeturn2search12

**Private-Sector Pathways:**
- Market responses to regulatory clarity, compliance programs, custody and payments infrastructure, and CBDC-adjacent pilots; industry comment processes evidenced by Treasury RFC responses (e.g., SIFMA). citeturn0search12

# Historical Analogs (coordination → standards/reporting → mixed uptake)
- **EO 13636 (2013) Cybersecurity:** interagency coordination and NIST Framework development; example of voluntary standards shaping private-sector practices. citeturn0search4turn0search7
- **AI EOs (2019, 2023):** whole-of-government tech governance playbooks; show how EOs lead to multi-agency plans, OMB guidance, and subsequent regulatory and international workstreams. Note: EO 14110 (2023) was later rescinded in 2025, showing reversibility across administrations. citeturn1search1turn1search0turn1search8turn1news27

# Scenario Table (18–24 month horizon; qualitative)
| Case | Core assumptions | Mechanisms in play | Indicative outcomes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Base** | FSOC/agency reports inform targeted rulemakings; limited congressional action; steady supervisory guidance | SEC/CFTC enforcement plus targeted rules; banking agencies issue guidance; Treasury/State advance FATF alignment | Incremental clarity for custodians and stablecoin arrangements; modest compliance spend; slower retail adoption; continued CBDC research without issuance (FR Sec. 4; FSOC 2022). citeturn0search0turn0search2 |
| **High** | Bipartisan legislation fills spot-market gap; coordinated stablecoin statute; agencies finalize key rules | FSOC recommendations adopted; harmonized market integrity/consumer rules; international coordination accelerates | Greater regulatory clarity; institutional participation may increase; stablecoin reserves standards; cross-border pilots expand; Fed continues research, no mandate to issue. citeturn0search2 |
| **Low** | Fragmented oversight; litigation bottlenecks; limited appropriations | Rulemakings slow or stall; divergent state/federal approaches; risk events heighten scrutiny | Prolonged uncertainty; higher compliance cost; slower product rollouts; risk of flight to offshore venues; scam losses may remain elevated per law-enforcement trends. citeturn0news67

# Evidence & Uncertainties
**Evidence:** FR text establishes scope and roles (Secs. 1–8); FSOC 2022 details risk and gap taxonomy (spot-market oversight, arbitrage, vertical integration). citeturn0search0turn0search2  
**Uncertainties:** congressional timing; jurisdictional boundaries across agencies; international rule divergence; macro/market shocks; incident-driven policy swings (e.g., scam/fraud spikes). citeturn0news67  
**Reversibility risk:** future administrations can modify or rescind EOs, as seen with AI EO 14110, affecting timelines and emphasis. citeturn1news27

# Disclosures
- This assessment interprets EO taskings; it is not legal advice, budget scoring, or market forecasting.  
- No amendments/revocations within EO 14067 itself; general provisions preserve existing authorities (Secs. 9–10). citeturn0search1
