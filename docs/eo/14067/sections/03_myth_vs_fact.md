# Myth vs Fact (receipts-first)

**Myth:** “EO 14067 turned on a CBDC and lets the government freeze accounts.”  
**Fact:** 14067 was a study and policy-coordination directive; it did not create a new currency or grant unilateral freeze powers. <PIN_FR14067_SCOPE>

**Myth:** “The administration already decided the CBDC design.”  
**Fact:** agency reports outlined tradeoffs and research topics, not a deployed design. <PIN_OSTP/TREASURY_PAGES>

**Myth:** “Nothing changed later.”  
**Fact:** EO 14178 (2025) revoked 14067 and introduced new framing, including explicit language distancing from a retail CBDC posture. <PIN_14178_SEC3_EXCERPT>
