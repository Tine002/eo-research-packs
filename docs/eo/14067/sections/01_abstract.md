# Abstract (neutral)

A receipts-first explainer for EO 14067 (2022) and the subsequent policy shift under EO 14178 (2025). The pack consolidates primary links, a mandate-output tracker, myth-vs-fact for non-experts, a CBDC design brief, an illicit-finance one-pager, energy/climate evidence, a comparative-law snapshot, a practical timeline, a stakeholder map, and three explicit scenarios. Citations pin to Federal Register and GovInfo; commentary is limited to framing and plain-language summaries.
