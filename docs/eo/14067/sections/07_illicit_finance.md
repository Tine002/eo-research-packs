# Illicit-finance lens (DeFi and beyond)

**What the official docs said:** summarize Treasury findings and the 2023 DeFi risk assessment with receipts. <PIN_TREASURY_DEFI_2023>

**One-pager: what regulated entities would need to do**
1. **KYC at onboarding** for custodial interfaces.  
2. **Transaction monitoring** for threshold-triggered reviews.  
3. **Sanctions screening** at touchpoints.  
4. **Recordkeeping** per Bank Secrecy Act analogs.  
5. **Reporting** SAR/CTR equivalents where applicable.

**Simple flow of KYC/AML touchpoints**
`User onboarding → Wallet link (custodial/hosted) → Transfer above threshold → Redemption/exit to fiat`  
At each arrow: KYC check, sanctions screen, and log retention. <PIN_FINANCIAL_CRIME_GUIDANCE>

> Keep it specific to regulated entities; do not imply rules for fully self-hosted software absent clear statutory text.
