**TL;DR**  
Executive Order 14067 (Mar. 9, 2022) sets a whole-of-government approach to digital assets. It outlines policy interests and objectives (Secs. 1–2), assigns coordination to the APNSA and APEP (Sec. 3), instructs research on a potential U.S. CBDC (Sec. 4), and directs assessments tied to consumer protection, market integrity, financial stability, illicit finance, and international cooperation (Secs. 5–8). It does not authorize new spending or create new agencies.

### Key Provisions (with section cues)
- **Policy & Objectives (Secs. 1–2):** consumer and investor protection, financial stability, illicit finance, human rights, inclusion, and climate/energy considerations.  
- **Coordination (Sec. 3):** APNSA/APEP lead an interagency process across departments and independent regulators.  
- **CBDC research (Sec. 4):** study and assessment only; no issuance order.  
- **Reports & International (Secs. 5–8):** risk, stability, and standards work, including FSOC assessments.

### Mechanisms
An EO states priorities. Agencies act under existing statutes through guidance, supervision, notice-and-comment rulemaking, and international standards work. Appropriations are unchanged by the EO itself.
