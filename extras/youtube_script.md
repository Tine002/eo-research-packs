# EO 14067 in 90 Seconds

[0:00] HOOK  
What did Executive Order 14067 actually do? Spoiler: it didn’t create a U.S. CBDC, and it didn’t ban crypto.

[0:06] CONTEXT  
Signed March 9, 2022, EO 14067 sets a government-wide approach to digital assets. It lays out policy interests and objectives, names who coordinates, and points to reports and standards work. (FR Secs. 1–3)

[0:18] THREE THINGS  
1) Objectives and coordination: Section 2 lists priorities like consumer and investor protection, financial stability, and illicit finance. Section 3 assigns coordination to the APNSA and APEP with a long roster of departments and independent regulators.  
2) CBDC research: Section 4 instructs research and assessment on a potential U.S. central bank digital currency. It is study and policy development, not an issuance order.  
3) Reporting and international work: Sections 5–8 direct assessments on consumer protection, market integrity, systemic risk, illicit finance, and international cooperation. FSOC reporting is part of this.

[0:48] IMPACT (MECHANISMS ONLY)  
An EO sets direction. Agencies act under existing statutes. Changes flow through guidance, supervision, and notice-and-comment rulemaking, plus international standards work. No appropriations or new agencies appear in the text.
