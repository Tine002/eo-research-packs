# EO Research Packs — GitHub Pages Site

[![GitHub Pages](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub%20Pages-enabled-brightgreen)](https://docs.github.com/en/pages)

This repository hosts public, source-linked research bundles for Executive Orders. The site publishes from the `/docs` directory so you can keep code and site content in one branch.

## What’s inside
- `/docs/index.md` — site index listing all EOs
- `/docs/eo/<EO_NUMBER>/index.md` — per-EO landing page with summary and bundle link
- `/docs/downloads/` — zipped research bundles for direct download

## Quick start
1. Enable GitHub Pages (Settings → Pages) and select `/docs` as the source after your first push.
2. Keep bundles inside `/docs/downloads/` so links work on the site.
3. Duplicate `/docs/eo/14067/` for additional EOs and update the index table.
